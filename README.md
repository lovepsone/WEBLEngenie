### WEBLEngenie
This project is an attempt to create a terrain editor, but it led to something more.

### Libraries used

*[three.js] (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) &mdash; JavaScript 3D Library.
*[Mesh BVH] (https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) &mdash; A BVH implementation to speed up raycasting and enable spatial queries against three.js meshes.
*[Ammo.js]  (https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js) &mdash; About
Direct port of the Bullet physics engine to JavaScript using Emscripten.

### Hotkeys (Testing, in developing)
#### Editor window
- mose wheel - resizes the pen when the pen is on
- w - on/off WareFrame
- e - switch brush/camera and back
#### Terrain editor tab, with re-enabled
- q - increases the intensity of the pen
- a - decreases the intensity of the pen
- alt + q - changing the type of intensity
- alt + a - changing the type of intensity

### Preliminary innovations (intent)

- Adjustable skybox
- Adjustable lighting
- Add options for road editor
- Add physics options
- Add vegetation generator
- Optimization and optimization again
